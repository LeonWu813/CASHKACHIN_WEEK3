          Scrum is a framework for developing and sustaining complex products.
          This Guide contains the definition of Scrum. This definition consists
          of Scrum’s roles, events, artifacts, and the rules that bind them
          together. Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland developed Scrum; the Scrum
          Guide is written and provided by them. Together, they stand behind the
          Scrum Guide.

                Agile teams are, by design, flexible and responsive, and it is
                the responsibility of the product owner to ensure that they are
                delivering the most value. The business is represented by the
                product owner who tells the development what is important to
                deliver. Trust between these two roles is crucial.

              <p>
                Scrum masters are the facilitators of scrum, the lightweight
                agile framework with a focus on time-boxed iterations called
                sprints. As facilitators, scrum masters act as coaches to the
                rest of the team. “Servant leaders” as the Scrum Guide puts it.
                Good scrum masters are committed to the scrum foundation and
                values, but remain flexible and open to opportunities for the
                team to improve their workflow.

                The development team are the people that do the work. At first
                glance, you may think the “development team” means engineers.
                But that’s not always the case. According to the Scrum Guide,
                the development team can be comprised of all kinds of people
                including designers, writers, programmers, etc.

        <p class="h4">
          A Scrum team is typically made up of “ten or fewer people,” as
          outlined by the Scrum Guide. However, the team’s size depends mainly
          on the project in view. The objective of the Scrum framework is to
          deliver value to the end-user by following a structure for iterative
          planning and fast delivery. For Scrum to be effective, there has to be
          strong communication, accountability, and collaboration between team
          members.
